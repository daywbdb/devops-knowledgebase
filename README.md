DevOps Role = Automation Engineers + Ops + Quality Engineers + Security/Network

Characteristics Of DevOps Work:

1. Different projects/products usually have many similar requirements or overlapped tasks.
2. Most tasks are off the record and trivial to plan, therefore hard to track effort for credit in-return
3. If fail to foresee potential risks of critical envs, DevOps life can easily be frustrating and fruitless.
4. All team members may contact with DevOps, so watch out low efficiency of communication.

What's DevOps domain: Build and Deploy? Anything exclude feature prorgramming?

2. Separate what tasks need intensive communication/prompt response from those don't
3. Measure key tasks by statistics and generate visualize  report.
4. Figure out a way to keep things/tasks in order and properly tracked
